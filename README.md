# Psi Omega Chapter Website

> A modern, responsive Next.js site for the Psi Omega chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi that showcases our brothers, values, and events.

## Overview

- _Purpose_: Serve as the public-facing portfolio for the Psi Omega chapter, providing information for prospective members, alumni, and corporate partners.
- _Audience_: Students interested in rushing, companies seeking professional collaboration, alumni, and the general public.
- _Problem Solved_: Centralises chapter information, streamlines recruitment resources, and highlights chapter achievements in a single, easily maintainable web app.

## Features

- **üì± Responsive Layout**: Multi-page site (Home, About, Meet the Brothers, Rush, Events, Database, Legacy) adapts to any screen size
- **üåà Animated Hero**: Smooth background gradient with typewriter text for a dynamic first impression
- **üîç Interactive Data Table**: Search, sort, and paginate brother information effortlessly
- **üç∞ Pie Chart Stats**: Visualise class demographics and statistics at a glance
- **üñºÔ∏è Image Galleries**: Showcase events and chapter history with responsive lightbox
- **üåì Dark Mode**: Theme toggle powered by context provider
- **üîê Protected API Routes**: Password-gated spreadsheet access for sensitive data
- **üõ†Ô∏è Reusable UI Library**: ShadCN components styled with Tailwind CSS utilities
- **‚úÖ Full Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript ensures reliability

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Next.js (App Router), React 18, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, Chart.js
- **Package Manager**: Bun
- **Tooling**: ESLint, Prettier, PostCSS, Vercel (deployment)
- _Architecture Highlights_: File-based routing, server & client components, API routes collocated with pages, reusable component library under `components/`.

## How It Works

1. Users navigate pages generated by the Next.js App Router. Most content is statically generated at build time for speed.
2. Client components (e.g., animated hero, charts) hydrate on the browser to add interactivity.
3. Protected API routes (`/app/database/api/*`) proxy requests to external spreadsheets after a password check.
4. ShadCN's headless components and Tailwind utilities provide accessible UI and theming.

## Setup and Installation

_Prerequisites_

- Bun ‚â• 1.0 (includes a compatible Node runtime)
- Git

_Steps_

```bash

# 1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/radatta/psi-omega-website.git && cd psi-omega-website


# 2. Install dependencies

bun install


# 3. Start the development server

bun run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000

```

## Usage Examples

```bash

# Build for production

bun run build


# Start the production server

bun run start

```

- Update images in `public/images` and pages auto-refresh.
- Add a new brother entry by editing `lib/brothers_data.ts`; the data table and chart update automatically.

## Project Structure

```

app/             # Route segments (pages, API routes)

components/      # Reusable UI and section components

  ui/            # Shared ShadCN-style primitives

lib/             # Static data, helpers, utilities

public/          # Images and static assets

hooks/           # Custom React hooks

```

The main entry point is `app/page.tsx`, and global styles live in `app/globals.css`.

## Challenges and Learnings

- Adapting legacy pages to the new Next.js App Router paradigm.
- Ensuring accessibility while integrating custom animations and gradients.
- Optimising large image assets without sacrificing quality.
- Leveraging Bun for faster installs and dev server startup times.

## Future Improvements

- **üìù CMS Integration**: Connect to a headless CMS for non-technical content editing
- **üöÄ Automated CI/CD**: Add GitHub Actions for lint, test, and deploy pipelines
- **üß™ Unit & E2E Tests**: Introduce Jest and Playwright test suites
- **üåê i18n Support**: Provide multilingual content for broader reach
- **üìä Analytics Dashboard**: Embed real-time site analytics for admin viewing

## Credits and Inspiration

- Bootstrapped with `create-next-app` and refined with ShadCN UI components.
- Chart visualisations powered by Chart.js.
- Animated gradient inspired by Vercel's gradient demonstration.
